<h2>Chicken</h2>
<p>The chicken has two legs and two wings, a fact that influences housing and management. Domestic chickens have essentially lost the ability to fly. Heavy breeds used for meat production cannot do more than flap their wings and jump to a little higher level or move more rapidly along the ground. The lighter-bodied birds can fly short distances, and some can fly over relatively high fences. The feet and shank portions of the legs have scales.Respiration rate is higher in chickens than in larger animals. In general, it can be said that the smaller the kind of bird the faster it breathes. For example, a hummingbird breathes more times a minute than a chicken. The male chicken breathes about 18 to 21 times a minute and the female about 31 to 37 times when they are not under stress.</p1>

<h2>Mutton</h2>

<p>We all love eating. There are no ifs or buts to that statement. Our love for food is so outreaching that we often don’t even know the contents of our food. Take for example two globally popular meat dishes, lamb and mutton. We know for a fact that they are two different types of meat, but how many of us really know which one comes from where? Well, lamb comes from sheep, while mutton comes from goat, right?The truth is that both lamb and mutton are meats obtained from sheep.The Oxford dictionary defines lamb as ‘a young sheep’, or ‘meat from a young sheep’, while mutton is defined as ‘meat from a fully grown sheep’. Meat from a sheep between the ages of one month and one year is served as lamb, while sheep older that one year</p1>

<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12" id="Sushi">
<h2>Sushi</h2>
<p>The word “sushi” is often ambiguous for non-native Japanese. We think of it as being interchangeable with raw fish. Sushi is vinegared rice topped with other ingredients. Sashimi, which is slices of raw fish alone, is not sushi because it isn’t accompanied with rice. Originally, sushi was fermented fish with rice preserved in salt, and this was a staple dish in Japan for a thousand years until the Edo Period (1603 to 1868) when contemporary sushi was developed. The word “sushi” means “it’s sour,” which reflects back to sushi’s origins of being preserved in salt</p1>
